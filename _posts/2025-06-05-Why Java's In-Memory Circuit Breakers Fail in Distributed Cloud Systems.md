Resilience is one of those architectural buzzwords that doesn't mean much—until production reminds you why you need it.

Most of us reach for libraries like **Resilience4j** or **Hystrix** when we want to wrap a method with a circuit breaker. And they work great... until your service starts scaling horizontally or going stateless.

That's exactly the problem I ran into. We were running Spring Boot services on **ECS with autoscaling** and later migrated some to **AWS Lambda**. Everything was stateless, and the moment we needed to rely on a circuit breaker to prevent cascading failures, it fell apart.

### 🔥 The Problem: Circuit Breakers That Think Locally

Imagine you have 5 instances of a service, each with an in-memory circuit breaker protecting a flaky downstream call.

Here's what happens:

- Instance A detects 3 failures, trips its circuit.
- Instance B is unaware, still making calls.
- So are C, D, and E.
- By the time all of them trip, the downstream is already on fire. 🚒

This is because **traditional circuit breakers are memory-bound**. Each instance maintains its own circuit state—there’s no coordination, no shared knowledge.

Which is fine... unless your infrastructure is distributed, which—let’s face it—is most of us now.

### ⚠️ Why This Matters in the Cloud

In systems built on **AWS Lambda**, **ECS Fargate**, or **Kubernetes**, your service might scale up to 20+ stateless containers. These environments are:

- **Ephemeral**: Containers/lambdas come and go.
- **Stateless**: No shared memory.
- **Disconnected**: No awareness of sibling instance behavior.

This makes **in-memory failure tracking completely useless** when you're trying to prevent a meltdown.

---

### 🧠 What I Needed Instead

I wanted a circuit breaker that was:

- **Distributed**: All instances share the same circuit state.
- **Stateless-friendly**: Works even if the instance gets replaced mid-request.
- **Pluggable**: So I can swap storage backends (starting with **DynamoDB**).
- **Simple**: Just drop an annotation and configure via YAML or env.

This led me to build [`cloud-circuitbreaker`](https://github.com/clinton1719/cloud-circuitbreaker).

### 🛑 Quick Preview: What It Looks Like

```java
@CloudCircuitBreaker(function = 'getUserData', fallback = 'fallbackFunction')
public Response getUserData(String userId) {
    return userService.fetchFromUpstream(userId);
}

public Response fallbackFunction(String userId) {
  return userService.fetchFromCache(userId)
}
```

This wraps your method. Behind the scenes, it tracks failures in a shared store (DynamoDB by default), and trips the breaker for **all instances** — not just the one executing the code.

### ✅ Coming Up Next

In **Part 2**, I’ll walk through how this works under the hood:

- Why DynamoDB?
- How failures are counted and TTL-managed
- How configuration and annotations plug into your Java app
