I'm a software engineer with a focus on building resilient, cloud-native systems using AWS. I specialize in backend engineering and distributed system design — working across Java, TypeScript, and cloud infrastructure to solve real-world problems at scale.

Currently, I architect and maintain systems that prioritize reliability, cost-efficiency, and clarity. My recent work includes developing a distributed circuit breaker framework backed by DynamoDB.

I'm especially interested in engineering practices that improve long-term maintainability: clear abstractions, testable components, and clean documentation. I believe great software is both practical and principled.

This blog is a mix of deep dives into system design, open-source experiments, and lessons learned building production-grade software in cloud environments.

If you're hiring or just want to talk shop — I'm always open to good conversations. You can find my code [on GitHub](https://github.com/clinton1719), or reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clinton-fernandes-45932915a/).
